    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    " Answer:- There are various methods used for web scraping. Here are some of the most common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing HTML: This method involves parsing the HTML code of a website to extract the desired data. It can be done using libraries like Beautiful Soup, lxml, and html5lib in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Web Scraping Frameworks: Web scraping frameworks such as Scrapy and PySpider can be used to extract data from websites. These frameworks provide a set of tools and libraries for web scraping, including data extraction, crawling, and data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using APIs: Some websites provide APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access data in a structured format. APIs can be used to extract data from websites without the need for web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated Data Extraction Tools: There are also various automated data extraction tools available that can be used to scrape data from websites. These tools typically use machine learning algorithms to extract data from websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Browser Extensions: Browser extensions like Web Scraper and Data Miner can be used to extract data from websites. These extensions provide a point-and-click interface for web scraping, making it easier for non-technical users to extract data."
